 <h3 class="style">No man likes to skip their chest day. Every single man in this world desires to possess a chest that sets an example of his strength in front of everyone and can be flaunted on a beach vacation. In order to get those desirable chest muscles, we research and try out various chest workouts for men a lot of times, but most of the time we just have to shake hands with failure despite our efforts.</h3>

      <center><h4 class="sub">Reps 20 and Rest 90sec </h4></center>
      <center><div class="style">Chest dips provide a great emphasize on your chest muscles. They are considered to be one of the most intense and hardcore bodyweight chest exercises for men. They completely rely on your own body weight, but additional weight can be attached to the body in order to increase the level of intensity. Chest dips are a great spotter-free alternative to the decline press.

         How to do it: Put your feet up behind you, lean forward as far as possible, and allow your elbows to flare out as you dip.</div></center>
