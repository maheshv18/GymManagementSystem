                <li><h3>Barbell Overhead Shoulder Press</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A barbell overhead shoulder press (aka barbell standing shoulder press) works not just your shoulders, but most of your body. </li>
                    <li>That makes it a terrific core strengthener and mass builder, among other things</li>
                    <li>To start, put your feet at shoulder-width, and tighten your core as you hold a barbell at your shoulders, palms facing forward. </li>
                    <li>Next, push the bar upward and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the peak. Lower steadily and carefully.</li>
                </ul>

                <li><h3>Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A proper deltoid workout simply isn’t complete without the seated dumbbell shoulder press.<br> In fact, some say this exercise routine is an entire deltoid regimen unto itself, targeting the anterior, lateral, and posterior deltoid muscles (with an emphasis on the middle delts).</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, lifting two separate dumbbells (as opposed to using a machine) prevents you from using one side of your body over the other, thereby retaining firmer balance and distribution. </li>
                    <li>Naturally, a fair amount of coordination is required to pull this one off, especially when you increase the weights.</li>
                    <li>To perform a seated dumbbell shoulder press, sit on a low-back bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand at the shoulder level, palms facing forward</li>
                    <li>Keeping your head and spine perfectly straight, lift the dumbbells overhead toward one another, stopping just short of having them touch at the top. Hold the position for a few seconds and then carefully reverse course. Repeat.</li>
                </ul>

                <li> <h3>Front Raise</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use either a weight plate or barbell for this shoulder exercise, which targets the anterior delts.</li>
                    <li>No matter what you decide to use, prepare for a seriously intense workout that brings no shortage of healthy pain.</li>
                    <li>For that reason, don’t max out on the weight, as it will quickly turn healthy pain into unhealthy injury.</li>
                    <li>To execute, keep your hands at hip height as you hold the weight in front of you. Your feet should be even with your shoulders and your core should be tight.</li>
                    <li>Next, retract your shoulder blades and keep your arms straight as you lift the weight to shoulder level. Breathe steadily and lower the weight carefully. Repeat.</li>
                </ul>


                <li><h3>Reverse Pec Deck Fly</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This exercise targets your posterior delts and requires a pec deck machine. </li>
                    <li>To start, face the machine, and position the seat so that the handles are at shoulder level on either side. Next, hold the handles with your palms facing inward.</li>
                    <li> Tighten your torso and extend your arms out to the side, pushing through all the way. Responsibly return to the starting position. Repeat.</li>
                    
                </ul>


                <li><h3>Bent-Over Dumbbell Lateral Raise</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This wildly effective shoulder exercise targets your middle deltoids, though it also builds upon your overall physique. You can perform it in either a standing (bent-over) or seated position. </li>
                    <li>Start with a dumbbell in each hand, keeping your chest up, your back flat, your knees slightly bent, and your eyes focussed toward a fixed point on the floor.</li>
                    <li> Now, bend over until your core is basically parallel with the ground, and hang the dumbbells directly underneath you, all while keeping your elbows in a slightly bent position.  </li>
                    <li>Next, raise both dumbbells up and out to your sides, forming an arc until your upper arms are even with your torso. Take a brief pause at the top before lowering the dumbbells back into starting position. Repeat.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
